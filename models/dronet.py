"""DroNet model wrapper for the modelblaster flow.

Sources the canonical PyTorch class from the vendored dronet_arch.py (see
that module's docstring) and loads the latest trained checkpoint by
default. The trained config is:

    img_dims = (112, 112)   img_channels = 3   small = True
    -> linear_in = 2048 (after the conv/pool stack).

Both 128×128×1 (the original demo) and 112×112×3 (the trained config) yield
linear_in=2048 with small=True; we follow the trained config so the loaded
weights match.

Override the checkpoint path via MODELBLASTER_DRONET_CKPT.

# scheduling / performance studies. The trained checkpoint only fits the
# default 112, so a rescaled model is left at its seeded random init: the
# golden is generated from those same weights, so bit-exactness still checks
# and the compute SHAPE is what the variant exists to vary. Its predictions
# are meaningless -- never quote a scaled variant as an accuracy result.
# MODELBLASTER_DRONET_CHANNELS selects the input channel count for GRAYSCALE /
# performance variants (default 3 = the trained RGB config, unchanged). A
# non-3 channel count cannot match the trained checkpoint's conv0 shape, so it
# is handled exactly like a rescaled geometry below: seeded random init, golden
# generated from the same weights, so correctness still checks and the compute
# SHAPE (grayscale = 1ch conv0) is what the variant exists to vary. Never quote
# a grayscale/scaled variant as an accuracy result.
